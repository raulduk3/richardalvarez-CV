\opening{Dear Hiring Committee,}

I am excited to apply for the Technology Resource Specialist position at Brooklyn Public Library. With a Bachelor of Arts in Film and a concentration in Integrated Humanities, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and a passion for serving diverse communities. I am prepared to relocate to Brooklyn as soon as I secure a role and am eager to contribute to BPL’s mission of fostering personal advancement and community engagement through technology.

In my previous role as an IT Assistant at Kenyon College’s Library and Information Services, I supported campus-wide technology needs, including troubleshooting hardware and software issues, conducting maintenance checks, and providing hands-on assistance to users. I also developed automated workflows to optimize team projects, such as scheduling classroom technology maintenance. This experience taught me the value of responsive customer service and the importance of adapting technical solutions to meet diverse user needs.

Beyond my work experience, my academic background includes coursework in Data Structures and Program Design, Software Development, and Digital Humanities, which equipped me with skills in Python, JavaScript, and data analysis. I have also led workshops and created resources to train others on new technologies, aligning closely with the TRS responsibility of training staff and users in library technology.

Key highlights that make me a strong candidate for this position include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Proven ability to troubleshoot and resolve hardware and software issues quickly and effectively.
    \item Experience leading computer training sessions, from basic use to advanced software tools.
    \item A strong understanding of Microsoft Windows, MS Office, and basic networking concepts, complemented by CompTIA ITF+ certification.
    \item Exceptional customer service skills honed through roles in technical support and collaborative environments.
    \item A passion for community outreach and youth education in technology, demonstrated through my mentorship roles and collaborative projects.
\end{itemize}

I am particularly inspired by Brooklyn Public Library’s commitment to equitable access to technology and lifelong learning. Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a deep commitment to empowering communities through technology. As a lifelong partner with the Black Data Processing Associates (BDPA), I have served as a mentor and national judge for the high school coding competition, helping students develop coding skills and problem-solving confidence. I will bring the same passion for education and community engagement to the TRS position, where I hope to foster learning and digital skills among BPL’s patrons and staff.


\closing{Sincerely,}
